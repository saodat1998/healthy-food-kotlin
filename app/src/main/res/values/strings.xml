        "The mobile app for recognizing healthy food from not healthy ones, which can help people look after their daily nutrition routines. \n\n
Users should only take a picture of particular food and the app can automatically distinguish the food type and alerts if the particular picture does not contain any food. \n\n
The PP.uz app can be developed in the near future by adding new functionalities to audio managing, so that it could effectively help to recognize food for sight limited or even blind people."
